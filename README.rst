Introduction
============
While researching a custom-built portable computer I stumbled upon the Mira 13.3" portable e-paper display. Due to the ability of connecting this display to existing computers I decided to forego the custom-built computer. Instead I opted to invest in this display after viewing an `extensive review`__.

Command line interface
----------------------
The device itself is spectacular but the settings application that is provided is slightly disappointing. The main feature I miss is scriptability, or a command line interface. So why not develop one myself?

Inspiration
===========
This project was inspired by the sources of the settings application provided by Onyx Boox. If you are interested in these sources yourself, head over to `this document`__.
